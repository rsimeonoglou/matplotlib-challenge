# Obervations:

1) Out of the top 4 drugs, there was only one mouse that was an outlier of tumor volume compared to the rest that were given the same drug. 
That mouse was c326 and was given the drug Infubinol.
    
2) Within the Capomulin regimen group, the weight of the mouse is statistically correlated with the size of the tumor, increasing about 0.95mm3 per gram of weight

3) After sampling multiple mice within the Capomulin, a theory could be that over time, the volume of the mice's tumors decrease when given Capomulin.
    This theory should be further analyzed to see if there is a negative correlation with the drug Capomulin and the mice's tumor volume over time.
